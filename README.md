Final Project Approval:

1). I do not have a data set to link, my plan is to take readings this next monday (on memorial day) of the amount of light outside of my apartment every hour from 7am-7pm. I will do this using the LightMeter app, we used this in biostats for a project. 

2). I plan on uploading excel data into jupyter. I will then be separating the data into "bins" that are morning, afternoon, and evening, which will be my manipulation of the data. I will then do a graph of time on the x-axis vs. light on the y-axis. I am hoping this is a straight foward, uncomplicated way to do this project! I think graphing in python is going to be the new skill learned for this project, but I don't think it will be too hard.
